# Event Planner, Project 2

Welcome to our Event Planner. This project was created by Ron Huff, Kyle Berkley, Weiting Wei, Diego Garcia, and Surabhi Khachar. 
This event planner allows users to create events with time slots for attendees to pick from. The functionality for creating 
task lists for events and multi-day scheduling has also been added. As a user, one can view all current events and pick their
availability for the event. 

To run this program you will need to have Visual Studio installed on your computer. The .sln file generated for Visual Studio 
compilation, however, is a Windows specific file that needs to be run from Visual Studio for Windows, not other operating 
systems. 

### Easiest Route to a Compiled Program:
* Clone the [Project-Setup](https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner/tree/Project-Setup) branch.  
 * Clone URL: https://github.com/ronhuff/Event-Planner.git
* Make sure to use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15).  
 * Run `EventPlanner.sln`

`EventPlanner.sln` will generate a Visual Studio project with all of the  
correct dependencies, paths and libraries set. The dependencies are listed in the dependencies folder. 

Once you are in Visual Studio, open the .sln file as its own project and hti CTRL-SHIFT-B to build the program. Building 
the program will also create an executable. After a successful build, you should be able to run the debugger to actually run
the program.
