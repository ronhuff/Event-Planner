This was the first meeting so there were no tasks to be completed.

Discussed:
- First step is to figure out what worked and didn't work from previous team's project (any functionality that did not make it on). Build it and check it out
and document what works and does not work.

For next meeting:
- Generate product backlog (Surabhi)
- Document functionality
