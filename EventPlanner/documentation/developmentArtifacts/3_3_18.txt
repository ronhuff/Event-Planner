Time: 6:30 p.m.
Location: Voice meeting over Discord

We accomplished tasks from previous meeting. We updated each other on the status of new functionality and figured out documentation.

Discussed:
- Why it is bad to have a superfile similar: we will lose modularity. Also discussed how to handle file IO for new implementation.

For next meeting:
- Meeting again over discord to wrap up new features tomorrow evening.
- Have completed all tasks by tomorrow evening (including documentation, process model, etc).
